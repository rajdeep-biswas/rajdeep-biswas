### Hello there üëã

I am a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer working @ [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html), Bangalore. üíª  
  
Most of my readable code that I write is for my job; outside of which my work is majorly an undocumented mess :)  
  
However, below are some of my utility projects that I dedicated time to make readable, and shall present as my portfolio (as is evident, I am not great at showing off my work).  

* [Anomaly Detection / Time Series Utility](https://github.com/rajdeep-biswas/Anomaly-Detection-Utility).
* [Forecasting Algorithms Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/rajdeep-biswas/excel2plot-pipeline).
* [COVID-19 India Daily Cases Prediction](https://github.com/rajdeep-biswas/covid19-prediction).

Although, I commit most of my code (including Jupyter Notebooks) to my GitHub for purpose of preservation (since I have frustratingly lost code in the past); if you do want to take a look around, delve at your own discretion. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Philosophy and Psychology are two areas I have no academic background in but it's impossible for me to not stay intrigued.  

When not working, I am best known for being a connoisseur of Hollow Knight lore <img src="hk.png" width="15" />, and Rick and Morty fanatic <img src="rick.png" width="18" />.
