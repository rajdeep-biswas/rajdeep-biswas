### Hello there üëã

I am a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer working @ SAP Labs, Bangalore. üíª  
  
I write most of my readable code for my work; outside of which my work is majorly an undocumented mess :)  
  
However, below is some of my utility projects that I committed dedicated time to make readable, and shall present as my portfolio (as is evident, I am not great at showing my work off, I prefer getting things up and running for the majority of time).  

* [Anomaly Detection / Time Series Utility](https://github.com/rajdeep-biswas/Anomaly-Detection-Utility).
* [Forecasting Algorithms Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/rajdeep-biswas/excel2plot-pipeline).
* [COVID-19 India Daily Cases Prediction](https://github.com/rajdeep-biswas/covid19-prediction).

Although, I post most of my code (including Jupyter Notebooks) to my GitHub for purpose of preservation (since I have frustratingly lost code in the past), delve at your own discretion. ‚ö†Ô∏è

When not working, I am best known for being a Hollow Knight lore connoisseur, <img src="hk.png" width="15" /> and Rick and Morty fanatic. <img src="rick.png" width="18" />.
